  - YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML is a strict JSON superset and includes extra features such as the notion of tagging data types, support for non hierarchical data structures, the option to structure data with indentation, and multiple forms of scalar data quoting. YAML is an open format.
  - YAML is one of the most popular data serialization languages, and it is used mostly for writing configuration files.
   - With YAML, you can define your API's endpoints, parameters, and responses in a clear and concise format. Tools like Swagger and OpenAPI take advantage of YAML's simplicity to generate beautiful and interactive documentation.
   - YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that is commonly used in DevOps. YAML provides several benefits for DevOps, including ease of use, readability, and flexibility. YAML can be used in DevOps for a variety of tasks, such as defining infrastructure, describing deployments, and configuring pipelines.
   - YAML is well-suited for configuration files due to its structured and readable format. It simplifies the process of defining configurations by using indentation and key-value pairs, making it manageable and adaptable for various software applications.
